# Konami Code Lab

## Objectives
1. Practice using event listeners

## Practice Using Event Listeners
In `konami_code.js`, you'll notice that there's very little code in the file. If you examine
what's there, you should see:
```js
const code = [38, 38, 40, 40, 37, 39, 37, 39, 66, 65]

function init() {
  // your code here
}
```

This array contains the famous [Konami Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konami_Code)
as keyboard event values. The Konami Code is a well-known button combination in the video
game community that unlocks special features. The up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-B-A key combination has become a common Easter egg for web sites
to have hidden features behind this code, and now you get to implement it!

In `index.html`, you'll see that the JavaScript file is already being loaded in for you:
```html
<script src="konami_code.js"></script>
```

You will need to:
- Attach an event listener to `document.body` and check for `'keydown'` events. 
  - If the user enters this special code, pressing all ten of the keys in the correct order, `alert()` a congratulatory message. 
  - If they press a key out of sequence or a key that isn't part of the Konami code, don't `alert()` anything and simply keep listening for all ten `keydown`s in the correct order.
*Remember to call `init()` when you're testing code in the browser to attach the event listener and set everything up!*

Here's a short example to help you get started:
```js
// Key codes for A, B, and C keys.
const alphabet = [65, 66, 67];

// Keep track of index outside of the event handler.
let index = 0;

// This is the function that would be invoked by the event listener.
function onKeyDownHandler(e) {
  const key = parseInt(e.detail || e.which);

  if (key === alphabet[index]) {
    index++;

    if (index === alphabet.length) {
      alert("Hurray!");

      index = 0;
    }
  } else {
    index = 0;
  }
}
```

Have fun!

#### Hints
* Be aware that we're looking at both `e.detail` and `e.which`. In modern browsers, `e.which` is usually enough; however, it's not universally supported, it's technically
deprecated, and it sometimes exhibits finicky behavior in the test suite. To be safe, you
might want to check `e.detail` or `e.location`. Or, to be safest, read the latest in the
[`keydown` reference on MDN][keydown]. This would be a good chance to use `console.log()`
to check out the value of `e.detail`, `e.which`, and `e.location`.

* Also note that we're calling `parseInt` on the key value. This is because the event
handler might pass us the string representation of the number, which wouldn't work so well
with our comparisons.
